      <h1>Which coding language will you pick up next?</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">You have got a bit of a handle on ECMAScript. Python let you build that game in your CS 102 course. CSS has been a necessary evil that has somehow <em>slightly</em> moved from a pain point to a source of visual zen and satisfaction. Yet there will always be a <strong>next</strong> language. With all the options out there, how is one to know which direction to go? Fear not. This survey will gather only the sufficient and necessary qualitities from you &mdash; its takers, store these data no where, and then point you in the best of all possible directions by making the right suggestion. Now a brief tidbit about the languages this survey might suggest you learn:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="all-languages">
      <h2>C Java Python C++ Ruby Go Swift TypeScript Kotlin</h2>
      <p>Without a whole lot of fuss or even a decent introduction to the qualities or typical applications of these languages, the image here shows which languages this survey could possibly suggest you learn next.</p>
