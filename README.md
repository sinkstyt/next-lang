# _Programming Language Suggester Survey_

#### What **IS** this "Programming Language Suggester Survey"?
_Once a person has picked up a programming language, there always beckons the question, "which coding language ought I learn next?" This survey was created using html, css, jquery, javascript, git, and GitHub to address this question._

_initially created from scratch the fifteenth of January, 2021_

## Technologies Used

* _html, css, JavaScript_
* _jQuery, Bootstrap_
* _VS Code_
* _git, GitHub, iTerm2_

## Description
_This project offers a selection of a few possible programming languages to learn. It asks a site visitor to respond to a few survey questions and returns one suggested language. The logic that works behind the scenes would probably not stand up to much serious scrutiny and is largely based on a brief perusal of rising languages in various sectors of the computer software/web development-related industries. To really make a reasoned determination about which language would be most beneficial to add to your quiver, the creator of this project suggests at least sleeping on whatever suggestion/result is achieved through the use of the survey._

## Languages included as possible suggestions
1. C
2. Java
3. Python
4. C++
5. Ruby
6. Go
7. Swift
8. TypeScript
9. Kotlin

## Setup/Installation Requirements
To download this project, view all of its contents, render the the whole thing in your browser to take it, and to tinker with it on your own machine, follow these steps:
1. Copy this https link to the repository: `https://github.com/sinkstyt/suggest-lang`
2. Launch your command line or Terminal application
3. Navigate to the preferred destination folder. For example, type each of these followed by pressing <kbd>ENTER</kdb>:
4. `$ cd ~`
5. `$ mkdir suggest-lang`
6. `$ cd suggest-lang`
7. `$ git clone https://github.com/sinkstyt/suggest-lang` (Here's where you could paste this https link copied from step 1)

> > From here you have two options:
#### Examine the files from within your text editor of choice (the command "code" should launch VS Code, but this may not be the case on your machine):
8. from the same directory to which you have just cloned down a copy of the whole thing from GitHub (in step 7), call:
`$ code .`

#### Render the page in a web browser to take the survey:
First copy to your clipboard the full local path to this project's folder. Thus, from within the directory to which you have cloned the project, call
8. `$ pwd`
_something like the following will be returned in your terminal:_
> `/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/Desktop/Epicodus/week2v2/suggest-lang`
9. Paste this file path into the address bar of a web browser but with the following added to the very end of the full address:
`/index.html`
> > So the whole address to be rendered by your browser might look like:
`/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/Desktop/Epicodus/week2v2/suggest-lang/index.html`

## Known Bugs

* _The navigation buttons "Previous" and "next" do not work as expected._
* _The survey's results were not yet displaying properly during most recent debug attempts._
* prject has only been tested in Google Chrome running on macOS Big Sur Version 11.1.
